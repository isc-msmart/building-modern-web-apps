Requires Cache 2016.2 or higher

Instructions:

1. Create a new CSP application called "/gs".

2. Copy the contents of the /angular-app subdirectory to the location specified in the CSP Files Physical Path for the "/gs" CSP application.

3. Create a new CSP application called "/gs/api".

4. Set the Dispatch Class for "/gs/api" to "Todo.REST".

5. Load and compile the classes Todo.REST and Todo.Task (from the /rest-service subdirectory) in the namespace for "/gs/api".

6. Run the command:

    Do ##class(Todo.Task).reset()

This will populate the Todo-list with example data as seen in the presentation.

7. Substituting your server and port where applicable, open http://localhost:57772/gs/index.html in your browser.

Enjoy!
